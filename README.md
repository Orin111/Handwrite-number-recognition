# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## 🤖 One-liner
**A neural network-based system for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.**

## 💀 Description
This project gets a picture of a number between 0 and 9 and recognizes which number is it using activition function and MLP network.
The program gets i weights files and i biases files (binary files), when i is the number of layers in the network.
then the program asks from the user to insert a path to the picture file.
it will analyze the file and print the number it found on the screen.

## Run example
